# JepsenFuzz

Inspired by [jepsen-io/jepsen](https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen) and [pingcap/tipocket](https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket), **JepsenFuzz** is a fuzzing-driven fault injection framework designed to test distributed databases. 

JepsenFuzz retains Jepsen's original functionality while incorporating fault scheduling based on fuzzing algorithms, enhancing the intelligence and effectiveness of fault injection.

JepsenFuzz is currently in development...
